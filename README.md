# cp (Unix)

My first program on C.
The command has three modes of operation to the program for copying a file to another file, one or more files to a directory, or for copying a directory to another directory.

## Usage

Copying a file to another file:

```bash
cp sourcefile targetfile
```

Copying file(s) to a directory

```bash
cp sourcefile... targetdirectory
```

Copying a directory to a directory 

```bash
cp -r  sourcedirectory... targetdirectory
````
